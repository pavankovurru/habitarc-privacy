  ## Data Collection

  ### We Do NOT Collect:

  • Personal information (name, email, phone number)
  • Habit data or completion history
  • Usage analytics or app behavior data
  • Location data or device information
  • Advertising identifiers or tracking data
  • Crash reports or diagnostic information

  ## iCloud Storage

  Your habit data is stored securely in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit
  framework. Here's how it works:

  **Private by Design:** Data is encrypted and stored in your iCloud account, not on our
  servers

  **Apple's Security:** Benefits from Apple's industry-leading security and privacy
  protections

  **Your Control:** You can manage, export, or delete your data through iCloud settings

  **Seamless Sync:** Data syncs securely across your devices without passing through external
  servers

  ### Requirements:

  Habitarc works with or without iCloud. With iCloud enabled, your data syncs across devices.
  Without iCloud, data is stored locally on your device.

  ## App Permissions

  Habitarc requests only one permission to provide its core functionality:

  **🔔 Notifications (Optional):** To send habit reminders at your chosen times

  ### Optional Permissions:

  This permission is clearly explained when requested. You can modify notification permissions
   in iOS Settings at any time. iCloud sync is managed system-wide in your iOS Settings.

  ## Your Rights

  You have complete control over your data:

  **👁️ Access:** View all your habit data within the app at any time

  **✏️ Modify:** Edit or update any habit information as needed

  **🗑️ Delete:** Permanently delete habits and data at any time

  **☁️ Account Deletion:** Remove all data by disabling iCloud sync in iOS Settings

  operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.

  ### When we make changes:

  • We'll update the 'Last updated' date at the top of this policy
  • Significant changes will be communicated through the app
  • You can always find the current policy in the app's Settings

  Your continued use of Habitarc after policy changes constitutes acceptance of the updated
  policy.
